BambooInvoice
=============

This is a fork from the original BambooInvoice, adding a few customizations. 

BambooInvoice is a nice invoice system, simple yet works well for me. 
I have been using it for a year but there's some features not satisfying my needs.
Since the original author no longer maintain it, so I decided to modify it my way and share with the open-source community.


## New Features
- You can now change the payment terms per invoice, instead of the global settings in the original version
